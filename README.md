TASK 3

       For developing the ecommerce solution I would recommend WordPress over the other main competitors on the market.

       WordPress offers many different themes and plugin that enable users to quickly create ecommerce solutions that are 
       are also robust. A popular Ecommerce plugin, WooCommerce, offers a secure and scalable platform for adding products 
       and taking payments. 
       Themes and plugins can be changed with limited technical knowledge, this is also true for adding products and pages.
       Thats one of the reasons WordPress has become so popular - the low learning curve.
       Also because of its popularity is has an extensive development community where users can reach out for help. There 
       are numerous sources of WordPress help such as articles, blogs and YouTube videos that cover every issue. 

       WordPress is also SEO friendly and enables ecommerce sites to have their own blog for organic traffic generation
       and once set up needs very little technical intervention - all employees can contribute with a small amount of training.
